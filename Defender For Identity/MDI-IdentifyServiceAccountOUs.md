# MDI - Identify Service Account OU

## Query Information

### Description

This KQL query is designed to identify accounts in Microsoft Defender for Identity whose Organizational Unit (OU) in Active Directory contains the word "service." It extracts the OU from the DistinguishedName field and filters for accounts where the OU name includes "service," helping to pinpoint service accounts within the directory.
